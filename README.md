## Notes
The final revision is a slight variation of [tophf/violentmonkey.css](https://gist.github.com/tophf/cc109b0ba5cb98353c9ea51579c85ae2) I changed the Brown text colors to the Monokai bright pink pallete.

The fist draft was a variation of [SuperOP535/Violentmonkey-Theme](https://github.com/SuperOP535/Violentmonkey-Theme) making changes to the Dracula color pallete. However I found subtexts were not being displayed correctly in the extensions dropdown. I don't know enough css to fix this issue so I decided to use [tophf/violentmonkey.css](https://gist.github.com/tophf/cc109b0ba5cb98353c9ea51579c85ae2) as a base instead.

The final version disables the "Advanced" button in the Violentmonkey options panel. this is not an issue for me because once this theme is added a longer need to advanced options.

## Purpose
Violentmonkey has an ["simple built-in dark theme"](https://github.com/violentmonkey/violentmonkey/issues/456#issuecomment-536090171Violentmonkey) feature which is set ["automatically in new browsers when the OS and the browser are using the dark mode."](https://github.com/violentmonkey/violentmonkey/issues/456#issuecomment-536090171Violentmonkey) This works great in Mozilla firefox and the new Microsoft Edge. 

However this feature doesn't work in my default browser Vivaldi or my favorite firefox fork [Librewolf](https://librewolf-community.gitlab.io).

Therefore I needed a solid dark theme that could be copy and pasted into the Custom style section in the options panel.

## Installing
Copy and paste the full content of [theme.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BelArvardan/Violentmonkey-Theme-Monokai/master/theme.css) to Settings -> Advanced -> Custom style and click save.
