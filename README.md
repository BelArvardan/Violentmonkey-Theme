## Notes
- The final revision is based on [tophf's violentmonkey.css](https://gist.github.com/tophf/cc109b0ba5cb98353c9ea51579c85ae2). I changed the Brown text colors to the Monokai bright pink added a few lines and commented out sections until I got the look I wanted.

- The fist draft was a variation of [SuperOP535/Violentmonkey-Theme](https://github.com/SuperOP535/Violentmonkey-Theme) making changes to the Dracula color palette. However I found subtexts were not being displayed correctly in the extensions dropdown. I don't know enough css to fix this issue so I decided to use [tophf/violentmonkey.css](https://gist.github.com/tophf/cc109b0ba5cb98353c9ea51579c85ae2) as a base instead.

## Purpose
- Violentmonkey has an ["simple built-in dark theme"](https://github.com/violentmonkey/violentmonkey/issues/456#issuecomment-536090171Violentmonkey) feature which is set ["automatically in new browsers when the OS and the browser are using the dark mode."](https://github.com/violentmonkey/violentmonkey/issues/456#issuecomment-536090171Violentmonkey) This works great in Mozilla Firefox and the new Microsoft Edge. 

- However this feature doesn't work in my default browser Vivaldi or my favorite Firefox fork [Librewolf](https://librewolf-community.gitlab.io).

- Therefore I needed a solid dark theme that could be copy and pasted into the Custom style section in the options panel.

## Installing
- Copy and paste the full content of [theme.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BelArvardan/Violentmonkey-Theme-Monokai/master/theme.css) to Settings -> Advanced -> Custom style and click save.
